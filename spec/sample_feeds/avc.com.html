<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/03/the-berkshire-hathaway-2008-annual-letter.html">The Berkshire Hathaway 2008 Annual Letter</a></h2>


<p>I took some time on Sunday afternoon to read <a href="http://bit.ly/7rvtI">Warren Buffett&#39;s annual letter</a>. I don&#39;t make it an annual practice to read the Berkshire Hathaway letter as many do (nor have I ever been to the shareholder&#39;s meeting which Buffett calls &quot;Woodstock for Capitalists&quot;). But given that 2008 was a year unlike any that I have ever witnessed, it seemed like the thing to do on a cold and snowy afternoon.</p><p>Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger are the most successful stock market investors of the 20th century and they have consistently outperformed the public markets as shown by this table of annualized returns that I put together with data from the first page of Berkshire&#39;s annual report (I love that Buffett starts with the numbers):</p><p><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e20112791754df28a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BH vs S&amp;P" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e20112791754df28a4 " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e20112791754df28a4-500wi" /></a>&#0160;</p><p>It is very interesting to me that the past five decades have seen the S&amp;P significantly outperform the long term average for equities of around 7% per annum. Even with the miserable performance of the public markets <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/11/a-lost-decade-.html">this decade</a>, we&#39;d have to be flat for another decade at least for the markets to average 7% per annum from 1965 on.</p><p>But Buffett and Munger&#39;s performance is something else entirely. While it is correlated to the market for sure, it has been so consistently superior for so long that it is clear that they are doing something right (and better).</p><p>So with that in mind, here&#39;s my take aways from reading Warren&#39;s letter.</p><p>1) The economy - It&#39;s really bad. Warren says the &quot;freefall in business activity&quot; is &quot;accelerating at a pace that I have never witnessed before.&quot;</p><p>2) TARP and related efforts to stablize the financial system - The Fed &quot;stepped in to avoid a financial chain reaction of unpredictable magnitude. In my opinion, the Fed was right to do so.&quot; But it will &quot;bring on unwelcome aftereffects.&quot; One likely consequence is &quot;an onslaught of inflation.&quot; And &quot;major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by cities and states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a political challenge. They won&#39;t leave willingly.&quot; That last line is classic and true and Obama&#39;s greatest challenge.</p><p>3) Berkshire&#39;s two most important businesses are insurance and utilities, sectors that &quot;produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy.&quot;</p><p>4) Buffet and Munger are value investors and contrarians. Warren says &quot;When investing, pessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy&quot; and &quot;Whether we&#39;re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down&quot; and &quot;Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.&quot; Words to live by.</p><p>5) Housing - Berkshire has exposure to the mortgage and housing market by virtue of its ownership of Clayton Homes, the largest company in the prefab home market. Buffett says &quot;Enjoyment and utility should be the primary motives for [home] purchase, not profit or refi possibilities. And the home purchased ought to fit the income of the purchaser.&quot; And &quot;an honest to God down payment of at least 10% [I think 20%] and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrowers income. That income should be carefully verified.&quot;</p><p>6) History as a predictor of the future - &quot;If merely looking up past financial data would tell you what the future holds, the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.&quot;</p><p>7) Quants - &quot;Beware of geeks bearing formulas.&quot;</p><p>8) Lean and mean organizations - &quot;BHAC: Who, you may wonder, runs this operation? While I help set policy, all the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew. Sure they were already generating $24 billion of float along with hundreds of millions of operating profit annually. But how busy can that keep a 31-person group? Charlie and I decided it was high time for them to start doing a full day&#39;s work.&quot; Wow. I&#39;m stunned. And now I have something other than Craigslist to use as an example of a lean and mean profit generating machine.</p><p>9) Bubbles and Panics - &quot;The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it.&quot; And &quot;When the financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the US Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost as extraordinary.&quot;</p><p>10) Derivatives - &quot;Derivatives are dangerous&quot; and &quot;When Berkshire purchashed General Re in 1998, we knew we could not get our minds around the book of 23,218 derivative contracts, made with 884 counterparties. So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and we operating in benign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete the task. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: &quot;I liked you better before I got to know you so well.&quot;</p><p>11) Risk and Responsibility - &quot;It is my belief that the CEO of any large financial organization <em>must</em> be the Chief Risk Officer as well. If we lose money on our derivatives, it will be my fault.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ll stop there because I really like lists with eleven entries. It&#39;s a quirk of my personality. All you have to do is read Warren&#39;s letter (or even my cliff notes version) to understand why he&#39;s the best investor of the past century. Common sense married with a native understanding of markets and value is what produces the returns at the top of this post. Everyone who invests and manages money for a living can take a lot away from Berkshire Hathaway and Warren and his partner Charlie. </p>

 The <a href="http://www.gothamgal.com/">Gotham Gal</a> opened the NY Times this morning and she says to me &quot;didn&#39;t we just put money into Citibank?&quot;. The we being all of us taxpayers here in the US. </p><p>I said, &quot;yes, a couple times I think&quot;. And then she got upset. Because there at the bottom of the NY Times is a big advertisement for Citibank (see the photo on the right).</p><p>She went on. &quot;We are paying for that ad. In a newspaper that less and less people read every day. No wonder they are in trouble&quot;.</p><p>There&#39;s something poetic, ironic, and iconic about that ad at the bottom of the NY Times today. It sums up so much of what we are all seeing and feeling these days.</p><p>Old school companies sticking to old school approaches that don&#39;t work anymore. All the while new companies with new approaches are succeeding and even thriving. Welcome to the <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/2008/02/economics-of-macropocalypse.cfm">macropocalypse</a>.</p><p>But there&#39;s a bigger issue here. Bob Lefsetz talked about it in his post last night<a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/02/28/privates/"> about Sheryl Crow and Maureen Dowd</a>.</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Northern Trust, a bank, took our money and then flew their peeps out to
Southern California for a golf tournament, where they wined and dined
them, even closed the House Of Blues so they could showcase Sheryl
Crow.&#0160; Only problem, we, the public, paid for this show!&#0160; What’s a
bigger crime, scalping tickets to shows people want to see, after all,
that’s supply and demand, or major corporations filching money from us
in great quantities?&#0160; Obviously, the latter.&#0160; But now it’s become a
sexy issue.&#0160; Because they’re truly doing it on our dime.<br /></em></div><p>When our government starts spending our money backstopping companies, then we start paying more attention to how those companies are spending our money. And we don&#39;t like it. It is going to get worse.</p><p>We are involved with a non-profit group here in NYC that is doing some very important work around parks and public spaces. In the past they had funding from companies like UBS and JP Morgan Chase. They can&#39;t tap that money anymore because those companies don&#39;t want to be doing anything &quot;inappropriate&quot; with public funds (as if supporting parks was inappropriate). And since all money is fungible, all of these companies&#39; funds are public funds now.</p><p>Being the CEO of a company who has taken government money is like having a big target on your back. Everything you do is going to be second guessed, debated and discussed like never before. &quot;Now it&#39;s become sexy because they are doing it on our dime&quot; Well said Bob.</p><p>This whole situation sucks. When government funds business, it messes everything up.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-blue-chip-stock-anymore.html">Is There Such A Thing As A Blue Chip Stock Anymore?</a></h2>


<p>On friday, we saw <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=c">Citigroup</a> do a recap and dilute the common stockholders significantly and we saw <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=ge">GE</a> cut their dividend by 2/3 to conserve cash. Both stocks are trading at below $10/share and are at fifteen year lows. There&#39;s a significant chance that the common stockholders on Citigroup will end up with nothing if the bank is nationalized. And GE is facing a huge debt maturity next year that could cause a similar outcome for its shareholders. And what about <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=gm">GM</a>?&#0160; That&#39;s another potential bankruptcy looming. The NY Times quoted an automotive consultant today about GM:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">“G.M. can’t raise more capital in the private markets, it can’t
influence demand and it can’t adjust its cost structure enough in the
short-term,” Mr. Casesa said. “There is no economic solution, only a
political one.”<br /></div><p>What do Citigroup, GE, and GM have in common? They are &quot;blue chip&quot; stocks and members of the elite Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/data/dow30/">30 stocks in DJIA</a> and they are the biggest and, in theory, the strongest companies in America.</p><p>But the past six months have taught us that no company is bulletproof and just because a stock is a &quot;blue chip&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it is safe. </p><p>In fact, we are learning the opposite. Here&#39;s the chart of the Dow since Nov 1, 2008:<br /><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011168a0acc9970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Dow" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2011168a0acc9970c " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011168a0acc9970c-500wi" /></a>
 <br />The Dow is down 25% since Nov 1, 2008 and is ~7% below the November lows.</p><p>Here&#39;s the chart of the NASDAQ since Nov 1, 2008:<br /><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e20112791538f528a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Nasdaq" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e20112791538f528a4 " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e20112791538f528a4-500wi" /></a>
 </p><p>The NASDAQ is down 20% since Nov 1st and is 7% above the November lows.</p><p>Six months doesn&#39;t mean all that much, but I think its instructive that the &quot;strongest&quot; companies in America have underperformed their smaller brethren and I think this trend will continue as we work our way out of the mess we are in.</p><p>I&#39;ve said this before and I&#39;ll say it again. This economic crisis is not limited to banks and housing. We are witnessing a &quot;sea change&quot; as my father in law called it today. Businesses that were built in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century are finding their underlying fundamentals challenged by a new economy that is global and driven by information and technology. Businesses that were built at the tail end of the 20th century and even in the 21st century are faring much better.</p><p>So be wary of &quot;blue chips&quot;. They aren&#39;t such a sure thing anymore.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/one-thing-you-dont-need-to-be-an-entrepreneur-a-college-degree.html">One Thing You Don't Need To Be An Entrepreneur: A College Degree</a></h2>


<p>We were in a board meeting today and the founder/CEO made a comment about a deal he&#39;s working on and I said &quot;well you learned that well in school.&quot; He smiled and said, &quot;we didn&#39;t go to school&quot; (meaning college). I didn&#39;t actually know that, but it did not surprise me. I have learned that where someone went to college (or even if they didn&#39;t go to college) has absolutely no correlation to whether they will be a good entrepreneur or not. I don&#39;t pay attention to that part of a resume. I focus on what they&#39;ve done in the work world, what they&#39;ve shown they can do, and most importantly what they&#39;ve done to date on that specific startup.</p><p>We chuckled about that exchange and the other VC on the board said &quot;I think twenty percent or more of our portfolio companies are led by entrepreneurs who didn&#39;t graduate from college.&quot;</p><p>That got me thinking about our portfolio. This is a guess because as I said, I don&#39;t really know for sure, but I think about seven or eight of <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/portfolio.html">the twenty-one portfolio companies listed on our website</a> have founders who did not graduate from college. It&#39;s not half, but it&#39;s a large percentage.</p><p>There are some reasons for this. Several of the founders of our portfolio companies grew up in other parts of the world where college attendance is less common. Some of the founders didn&#39;t have the patience to sit through four years of education they didn&#39;t feel was relevant to them. And some of the founders were too busy starting companies to finish college. </p><p>Entrepreneurs don&#39;t need degrees like lawyers and doctors do. They are credentialed by virtue of their track record. The first startup is hard but if they make that one work, they end up with something much better than a college degree. They have a notch in their belt. They&#39;ve got a track record of success. Even if the first one is a failure, I&#39;d say that they&#39;ve got something more than a degree. They&#39;ve shown they can start something from nothing, build a team, a product, and maybe even a business.</p><p>We&#39;ve been spending a lot of time lately thinking about, talking about, learning about, and looking at the whole education sector. Education is critically important. But you don&#39;t have to go to school to be educated and if being an entrepreneur is your goal in life, that&#39;s even more true.</p>

<p>Our portfolio company <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> started out last year building an entire open source cloud computing stack and based on feedback from the market they recently opted to focus entirely on the data store component, called <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a>.</p><p>My partner Albert, who sits on 10gen&#39;s board, has a blog post up today <a href="http://continuations.com/post/81410630/welcoming-10gens-mongodb-datastore">talking about MongoDB and who should be trying it out and why</a>:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>MongoDB is a much better fit for most web development than a
traditional relational database.&#0160; Instead of requiring an ORM layer,
MongoDB simply stores objects as documents in the database.&#0160; This is
very fast since it eliminates a lot of overhead and therefore scales
much better than a relational DB+ORM.&#0160; Yet it retains all the
flexibility for super agile development.&#0160; Need a new field in your
objects?&#0160; Just start saving new objects with that field.&#0160; Need a new
collection of objects?&#0160; Just start saving to it!<br /></em></div><p>If you are a web developer and are curious what MondoDB can do for you, you can <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads">download it here</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/ten-thoughts-on-the-presidents-speech-last-night.html">Ten Thoughts On The President's Speech Last Night</a></h2>


<p>1) &quot;The USA will emerge stronger than before&quot; That&#39;s a tall order. I&#39;d settle for we will recover. Given the demographics of the changing world we live in (read Zakaria&#39;s Post-American World), I wonder if that&#39;s a promise the President should be making.

</p><p>2) I read the speech in its entirety twice and did not find one mention of immigration. The President says we owe our prosperity to our ingenuity and tenacity. I think that&#39;s true but a lot of that ingenuity and tenacity came from first and second generation immigrants. If we are not prepared to open up our borders more broadly to the best and brightest and toughest in this world, all the rest is just words

</p><p>3) His recovery plan has three initiatives, a revised TARP, HASP, and stimulus. That&#39;s it. I did not get the sense that there is more after that. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good or bad, but that&#39;s the hand he&#39;s playing.

</p><p>4) Hardest working people on earth? C&#39;mon Barack. Don&#39;t bullshit us. Go back and read number two.

</p><p>5) He&#39;s also got three domestic priorities; energy, health care, and education. He&#39;s right that our economy is highly impacted by them. I&#39;m limpressed that he&#39;s picked some stuff to focus on and I think these are three great areas to focus on for long term sustainability.

</p><p>6) 95pcnt of the jobs created with stimulus will be private sector jobs. That&#39;s a great factoid. Let&#39;s put a big pie chart on the front page of <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">recovery.gov</a> and chart that in real time please.

</p><p>7) A new accountability for money spent saving banks. Barack said &quot;I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assitance they receive&quot;. Good luck with that. Money is fungible. It doesn&#39;t have RFID tags on it. Trust me on this one. I know a bit about handing over money to companies. There&#39;s only one way to know it will be spent well and that is smart, honest, and capable management. An army of accountants is going to get unleashed on the banking sector and god help them and us.
</p><p>8) &quot;its not about helping banks - its about helping people&quot; I&#39;m with the president on this. I also appreciate his statement that his job is to solve the problem. He&#39;s got that right. I&#39;ll be measuring him on how he does on that measure. Its a hard problem made harder by the people whose house he was in last night. I&#39;m rooting for him. We should all be rooting for him.
</p><p>9) Energy - the best part of his speech was the bit about energy. He gets it. But the auto sector has the potential to be the &quot;vietnam&quot; of his energy plan. Act swiftly and courageously there Mr President or it could be a noose around your neck. Just look at GM. In two short months they are back on your doorstep with their hands out. When a portfolio company acts like that in our business, they are dead on arrival. </p><p>10) Education - I think the President missed an opportunity last night to call on the private sector to invest in education. There are literally thousands of amazing entrepreneurs working in this industry and I think they&#39;ll collectively do more to reform and reinvent education than anything that comes out of washington. 

</p><p>11) Fiscal discipline. Its a bit surreal to be talking about balancing the budget in light of stimulus, HASP, and TARP. The only way its going to happen is huge cuts in defense spending and a wholesale re-evaluation of our domestic spending priorities. Watching Pelosi and Biden behind the President <a href="http://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1247572676">was distracting</a> and a reminder that as well intenioned as Obama is, he&#39;s got an impossible job. </p><p>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Please let me know what you thought of it in the comments.

</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/a-time-for-assessing-strategic-opportunities.html">A Time For Assessing "Strategic Opportunities"</a></h2>


<p>This morning I am going to talk at <a href="http://www.pillsburylaw.com/emerginggrowth">Pillsbury</a>&#39;s invitation only session for their entrepreneur clients. <a href="http://www.pillsburylaw.com/bo">Bo Yaghmaie</a> has asked several VCs to talk about situations in their portfolios where they&#39;ve had to engage deeply with a company in reaction to the changing environment we are now in.</p><p>It&#39;s a good topic for sure. While I am uncomfortable talking specifically about any of our companies and the goings on inside the companies (either here or at Bo&#39;s event this morning), I will say that I think its time for all companies to assess their &quot;strategic opportunities&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Strategic opportunities&quot; is often a code world for &quot;sale process&quot; and I think that is certainly one thing that all companies should think about. But I am talking about a more comprehensive strategic process.</p><p>We&#39;ve been asking many of our companies to do a deep strategic planning process. The most developed of them already do this as a matter of practice. But many of the younger companies have been largely focused on product and engineering issues and have not stepped back and thought deeply about the big picture.</p><p>In a difficult market environment, it&#39;s time well spent. Money is tight and who knows if there will be another round of venture funding. So it&#39;s critical to step away from the product roadmap and think a bit about &quot;what you want to be when you grow up&quot; and set some clear goals for the business in addition to the product.</p><p>That process should also include a clear assessment of the resources required to achieve the goals and the time frame involved. Then end result should be a business plan that includes both a strategic and financial plan. The financial plan should be at least for the next 18 months and ideally a bit further than that if it&#39;s possible to see out that far.</p><p>Once that is completed, all the stakeholders can have a conversation about the economics of the plan, the risks involved, and the ideal way to capitalize the plan.</p><p>That can sometimes lead back to the &quot;strategic opportunities&quot; aka sale process. When founders, managers, and investors stare at the cold reality of the business plan, they sometimes conclude that the plan is better financed by a strategic buyer than the venture capital or other capital markets. </p><p>But more often, the plan is a catalyzing event for a round of financing. And in this market, that is often provided by the existing investors, who after going through the strategic process conclude that there is value in the opportunity and they are willing to see it through.</p><p>The worst place you can be in this market is out of money and without a plan. The liklihood is high that you&#39;ll be out of money at some point. Just don&#39;t be there without a plan.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/a-stimulus-plan-for-venture-capital-no-thanks.html">A Stimulus Plan For Venture Capital? No Thanks.</a></h2>


<p>Tom Friedman, who I admire in many ways, has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/opinion/22friedman.html">an op-ed piece in today&#39;s NY Times</a> where he suggests that the US government take the bailout money they are thinking of giving to the auto industry and instead give it to the top venture capital firms.</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>You want to spend $20 billion of taxpayer money creating jobs? Fine.
Call up the top 20 venture capital firms in America, which are short of
cash today because their partners — university endowments and pension
funds — are tapped out, and make them this offer: The U.S. Treasury
will give you each up to $1 billion to fund the best venture capital
ideas that have come your way. If they go bust, we all lose. If any of
them turns out to be the next Microsoft or Intel, taxpayers will give
you 20 percent of the investors’ upside and keep 80 percent for
themselves.<br /></em></div><p><br />I understand the point Tom is making - that we ought to be investing in the future instead of the past. And for that, I applaud him.</p><p>But the venture capital business, thankfully, does not need any more capital. It&#39;s got too much money in it, not too little. Just ask the limited partners who have been overfunding the venture capital business for the past 15-20 years what they think. You don&#39;t even need to ask them. They are taking money out of the sector because the returns have been weak.</p><p>And the top 20 firms in the venture capital business are the least in need of a bailout of any group I&#39;ve ever thought about. These firms, the Sequoias and Benchmarks and Accels and Kleiner Perkins etc etc can raise a fund anytime they want. Accel raised a ton of money last fall in the midst of the worst global financial meltdown in my lifetime.</p><p>The venture capital business is an asset class where the top 10-20 percent of the firms make 80%+ of the returns. That&#39;s how its always been and that&#39;s how it will likely always be. It&#39;s because the best entrepreneurs want to work with firms with reputations for making money, making connections, recruting top talent, and getting the right exit at the right time. And those are the top 10-20 percent of the firms.</p><p>So Tom&#39;s idea, while it looks good on paper, is a dream. The top venture firms don&#39;t want, don&#39;t need, and are never going to take government money. The same is true of the top entrepreneurs.</p><p>The worst firms, on the other hand, will gladly accept government money. And that is what is going to happen with all of these government efforts to pour more money into the &quot;innovation sector&quot;. That money will go to bad investors and weak entrepreneurs and management teams for the most part. It&#39;s a problem of adverse selection. </p><p>If you take a look at all of the economically targeted investment programs that have been built and managed over the past twenty years in the venture capital industry, you&#39;ll see this plain and clearly. </p><p>There are some good ideas out there. My friend Brad Feld told me about a new legislative effort in Colorado to give angel investors a 50% tax credit for making investments in early stage companies. That makes better sense to me. Let the market work but lubricate it a bit with tax credits, particularly for the angel sector which has been the most hurt in this downturn.</p><p>But please leave the venture business alone. It&#39;s working pretty well as it is and it certainly doesn&#39;t need more money or some kind of stimulus plan. </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/founder-dilution-how-much-is-normal.html">Founder Dilution - How Much Is "Normal"?</a></h2>


<p>This is a subject near and dear to entrepreneurs, maybe the dearest subject of them all. Founders start out with 100% of the company and every time they raise capital and/or issue stock and options to their management team, that number goes down.</p><p>Founders who &quot;go all the way&quot; through the process of building a lasting and sustainable/profitable business (as opposed to an early exit) will generally suffer the most dilution. In my experience, it will generally take three to four rounds of equity capital to finance the business and 20-25% of the company to recruit and retain a management team. That will typically leave the founder/founder team with 10-20% of the business when it&#39;s all said and done. The equity split at 20% for the founders will typically be; 20-25% for the management team, 20% for the founders, and 55-60% for the investors (angel all the way to late stage VC).</p><p>That&#39;s a rule of thumb and it can be worse (I&#39;ve seen founders end up with less than 5%) and it can be better (the google founders own &gt;25% of the company after the dilution of an IPO). It all depends on the amount of capital a company needs to raise and the valuations it can raise it at and the timing of those financings.</p><p>Founders who opt for a &quot;quick flip&quot; or any form of early exit (early means to me before the company becomes sustainable/profitable) can see much less dilution. Joshua Schachter owned more than 50% of delicious when it was bought by Yahoo! The four founders of FeedBurner owned well north of 25% of the company when it was sold to Google. Those exits are generally for less money so its more ownership times less total value. But even so, that can work out well for the founders and is a big reason why early exits continue to be part of the venture capital landscape.</p><p>Most of what I&#39;ve just written is pretty well known in the venture capital/startup world. Sim Simeonov of Polaris Venture Partners <a href="http://simeons.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/founder-dilution/">would like to get a more exact set of data on this</a> and he&#39;s put up <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cGZZaHVQVlYyV3J1ampMRUk0ME1LU1E6MA..">an online survey</a> hoping that entrepreneurs of all kinds will take the time to fill it out so we can be more exact.</p><p>It&#39;s a short survey and won&#39;t take long to fill it out. So if you&#39;ve got data to share, please take a minute or two and <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cGZZaHVQVlYyV3J1ampMRUk0ME1LU1E6MA..">fill out the survey</a>.

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/welcome-to-the-dark-side-marc-and-ben.html">Welcome To The "Dark Side" Marc and Ben</a></h2>


<p>I think this is big news although I have not seen anyone pick up on it yet. Last night <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10093">on Charlie Rose</a>, <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/">Marc Andreessen</a> told Charlie that he and his longtime business partner (and CEO of Opsware/Loudcloud) Ben Horowitz are getting into the venture capital business on a full-time basis. They are forming a new firm and raising a venture fund.</p><p>Marc and Ben have been active angel investors in web/tech for a while now. They are co-investors with our firm Union Square Ventures in a number of companies, including delicious and twitter. They are smart and experienced and plugged in. That&#39;s a formula for success.</p><p>The entire interview with Charlie is terrific and I agree with almost everything Marc said on the show. But if you want to get to the news about the new VC fund fund, <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10093">click thru to the video</a> (no idea why you can&#39;t embed it) to 18:30 in and watch Marc talk about it.</p><p>If you look at the history of Silicon Valley venture capital firms, there is a rich tradition of experienced entrepreneurs and operators leaving the operating side of the business and starting venture firms in the middle of their careers. Marc and Ben are the latest to do this and I expect they&#39;ll be very successful and we hope to continue to invest with them as they build their firm.</p><p>UPDATE: Now the news is starting to percolate out across the tech blogs:</p><p>- <a href="http://www.pehub.com/32230/andreessen-launches-vc-fund/">PE Hub</a></p><p>- <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/20/andreessen-on-charlie-rose-i-am-creating-a-fund-full-video/">TechCrunch</a></p><p>- <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20090220/marc-andreessens-new-venture-fund-project-a/">Kara</a></p><p></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/taking-it-to-the-hood.html">Taking It To The Hood</a></h2>


<p><em>Note: This is a first for the AVC blog. I did not write this post. It was written by Jeff Minch, known to this community as <a href="http://disqus.com/people/JLM/#main">JLM</a>. Jeff has been leaving comments on this blog for the past six to nine months and I&#39;ve enjoyed reading them very much. Jeff has a very different view than I do about politics and about other areas as well. But you cannot read his opinions and not come away impressed and thinking differently. That&#39;s the kind of voices we have here in our community and I am excited about sharing some of them with all of you every once in a while. I don&#39;t plan to do this very often, but I do plan to do it from time to time. With that said, please enjoy Jeff&#39;s thoughts on the President&#39;s housing plan.<br /></em></p><p>Taking it to the Hood<br />The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan</p><p>Fred Wilson asked me to react to the President’s housing initiative and I am honored to do so.&#0160; I find “A VC” to be the single best blog that I have the opportunity to read primarily because of the content offered by its participants and their obvious qualifications but also because of the comity of the dialogue and the ability for strong willed folks to disagree without being disagreeable.&#0160; Fred has chosen some great blog topics and while there is a “forum” quality to the actual dialogue, it is the selection of the topics which focuses all of that intelligence.</p><p>The TARP was for Wall Street.&#0160; The Stimulus was for Main Street.&#0160; The HASP is for the Hood.&#0160; There will be much to like and there will be much to dislike.&#0160; A frame of reference:</p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Our Nation was in great measure formed by folks who had a desire to have their own house.&#0160; A gross oversimplification, I am sure but a bit of truth nonetheless.&#0160; Increasing home ownership in the United States after World War II was one of the single most important elements in the wealth creation and evolution of the culture of that extraordinary time.</p><p>2.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Housing is both physical and emotional as it is where our sweetest memories are made, discussed and lived.&#0160; It is where our hearts are and if we fail in this arena we have more than just financial failure, we have broken hearts and a diminishing of the American dream.&#0160; [If you knew me well, you would be amazed to hear me say something so “squishy” like that but I have my own reasons.&#0160; More importantly, I truly believe it.]</p><p>3.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Housing --- or perhaps I should say abuses of housing, particularly housing finance --- is at the root of our current financial problems.&#0160; There is plenty of blame to go around without resorting to political finger pointing.&#0160; A good idea got swept up in the euphoria of the times and we allowed basic rules of finance to be violated at the personal, industry, banking, regulatory, legislative, GSE and securities levels.&#0160; Housing was the spark which ignited the flames which fanned out of control.&#0160; It is good therefore that President Obama is addressing a root cause of the problem.</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Homes are very important to the fabric of our Nation from a social perspective and while I cannot readily quote any supporting figures, I can say with some conviction that a child raised in a stable home is more likely to become a contributor to society rather than a cost center to society; and, conversely the opposite is also true.&#0160; [At the end of the day, all we are trying to do is to get the taxpayers to outnumber the recipients of government largesse.]</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Home equity represents the most important (and generally hidden) asset in most folk’s lives when it comes to building long term retirement equity.</p><p>So, I am a big fan of stable homes for a number of reasons.</p><p>On the whole, the HASP is a damn good start but it is only a start.&#0160; Is it perfect right out of the chute?&#0160; Hell no.&#0160; Here are the things I like in the order in which I like them:</p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; I think the probability of the plan working is dramatically heightened by the President’s wisdom in originating the plan in his office rather than having the Congress draft legislation and running afoul of the partisan minefields such action would generate.&#0160; President Obama can barter a bit of political capital in this endeavor by direct sponsorship and can avoid the unifying opposition of having Speaker Pelosi being the plan’s sponsor.</p><p>2.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; I just love the idea that a Federal Bankruptcy Judge can intervene in the dialogue between a bank and a borrower and take immediate and almost unappealable action to force a mortgage settlement.&#0160; This is a shadow of the “cram down” provision of bankruptcy law but it is even more effective because neither party regularly appears in that Court and thus there is a real balance of terror.&#0160; Federal Bankruptcy Judges are the most powerful Judges in the judiciary, they are experienced in dealing with tales of woe, they are very decisive and do not suffer fools well.&#0160; It will also motivate banks to settle things quickly once they know the model which will be used.&#0160; This will help deal with all of the mortgages, including jumbo mortgages, which are not held by the GSEs.&#0160; The Federal Bankruptcy Judges I know will be able to modify a mortgage in about 12 minutes.</p><p>3.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The application of a specific financial yardstick at 38% of gross income able to be “bought down” to 31% is pragmatic.&#0160; Of course, this will be complicated by the ability of a borrower to free up other funds to inject equity but it is a good start.&#0160; I would have liked the final residual number to have been 25% because I think we are still headed downward for about 12-18 months.</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The other important element of this buy down approach is the ability to now put a definitive price on the formerly “toxic” assets.&#0160; Remember, the most important element to trading this stuff off balance sheets has been the inability to price it.&#0160; This solves a lot of that problem.</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Discrimination between those already in the ditch and those who are at the edge of the abyss as well as those whose only real problem is the declining value of their home is useful and while it doesn’t cover every single circumstance, it does cover a huge portion.</p><p>There a couple of areas which merit a bit of discussion and undoubtedly will require some modification.</p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; First, let me ask that everybody go re-read the <a href="http://www.bcbsr.com/survey/pbl15.html">Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard</a>.&#0160; Why?&#0160; Because like laborers in the vineyard, the HASP will leave some folks feeling like they were mistreated because they were prudent in their mortgage dealings and will not benefit from the HASP.&#0160; My answer?&#0160; “Friend, I am doing you no wrong.”&#0160; There are just some things in the life of a Nation in which you simply cannot get the toothpaste back into the tube regardless of how firmly we believe that is the just solution.</p><p>2.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The plan is simply too complex on its surface.&#0160; This is a problem with President Obama, he is smart and he assumes that others are equally smart.&#0160; The average Wharton MBA could not read the Executive Summary of this plan and “brief back” its provisions from memory.&#0160; The borrowers?&#0160; Hey, they didn’t provide income documentation and were not interested in a lot of paperwork to begin with --- do you think they are going to come trotting into their bank with a bunch of documentation now?&#0160; The plan has to be simple enough that a high school grad (OK, in the top half of his class.) could understand it.</p><p>Does a fish taste any different if you catch it with a worm, hook, bobber, line and a cane pole?&#0160; KISS --- keep it simple for the stupid!</p><p>3.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The plan does nothing to stop pending foreclosures.&#0160; I would like to have had a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures currently pending.&#0160; It is outrageous that banks receiving TARP funds are not called to cooperate fully with all government sponsored bailouts.&#0160; They were first in line to receive assistance and they should also be first in line to provide assistance.&#0160; These guys owe us!</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; I hate the provision that if a borrower who has received a loan modification is current in their payments that they receive $1,000 annually for five years.&#0160; When a cute little mouse has his leg removed from a trap, he does not negotiate for a piece of the cheese before scurrying away.&#0160; This paternal approach is really insulting to all involved.&#0160; Everybody should get one chance to be saved with no do overs.</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; I wish the plan had a provision that the “work out” financing could also be applied to first time home purchasers in order to soak up some of the excess inventory out there.&#0160; Missed opportunity to work down the supply of troubled housing and for banks to reduce their REO.</p><p>6.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; There is a sense that the mortgage modifications are only going to be for five years.&#0160; This is silly.&#0160; Make them permanent and make the solution permanent.&#0160; Five years is not very long for an asset which is normally financed over 30 years and which can last for 100 years.&#0160; There is ample evidence that re-default rates are as high as default rates.&#0160; Solve the problem permanently.</p><p>7.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The government should get an “equity kicker” for their trouble.&#0160; If you participate in the plan and peg a new value on your home, then the government should get either a par payoff of a 25% equity kicker above the marked down price for the next ten years.&#0160; Why not?</p><p>In closing, let me say that of the three plans advanced thus far I like the HASP the best.&#0160; Remember we are only talking about a national mortgage delinquency rate of something less than 7%, so while the problem is huge in terms of dollars it is really more manageable in terms of the numbers of folks impacted.&#0160; We desperately need a win on the economy and this may be a promising start.</p><p>I rate the TARP at zero probability of working because I think that Darwin was right all along.&#0160; I rate the Stimulus at 25% with its most significant failing its disconnect between the spending and the creation of jobs.&#0160; I rate the HASP at 50% with the possibility to engineer that upward with some simple modifications.&#0160; Thanks for listening.</p><p>---------</p><p>Fred&#39;s Update: You might enjoy watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZB4taSEoA">the Rick Santelli rant on CNBC</a> in conjunction with this post. What a great discussion and debate we are having here. I love it.</p><p>Fred&#39;s Update 2: I measure the success of a post by the number of comments. By that score, JLM hit one out of the park with over 100 comments and still growing in less than 24 hours. Well done JLM, great topic, great post, and great discussion. You will be a tough act to follow.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/guest-bloggers.html">Guest Bloggers</a></h2>


<p>I spent some time this morning reading two articles in the NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/19housing.html">about Obama&#39;s $275bn housing plan</a>. I thought to myself that I wanted to know more about this plan. Is it a smart plan? What are the problems with it? How likely is it that this plan will be helpful in ending the decline in the housing market?</p><p>And my mind turned to a blog commenter named <a href="http://disqus.com/people/JLM/#main">JLM</a> who has left some of the best comments here about the pickle we are in with housing and how we are likely to get ourselves out of it.</p><p>So this morning I asked JLM to tell us what he thinks of the housing plan. He&#39;s agreed to do that and when I get his email I will post it to this blog.</p><p>He will be the first and only guest blogger to have posted here in the five+ years I&#39;ve been doing this.</p><p>I still plan to post every day and please don&#39;t think I am trying to lighten my load.</p><p>But I do think that this blog is slowly turning into a community and its high time that some of the stronger voices get some air time.</p><p>Next up will be Steve Kane on IP, if he takes me up on it!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/the-valentines-day-breakup.html">Why Hulu Should Embrace Boxee</a></h2>


<p>For those that don’t know, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/" rel="homepage" title="Union Square Ventures">Union Square Ventures</a> is an investor in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.boxee.tv" rel="homepage" title="Boxee">Boxee</a> and I am on the board. For the past several weeks I have watched Boxee&#39;s management try their hardest to convince <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.hulu.com/" rel="homepage" title="hulu">Hulu</a> that Boxee is a big step forward for Hulu and Hulu&#39;s content partners.</p><p>Unfortunately, Boxee has yet to be successful with that effort and <a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2009/2/18/doing-hard-things">later this week Hulu content will disappear from Boxee</a>. I hope it is a short separation that leads toward a long and happy relationship. Boxee&#39;s management is committed to working with Hulu to make that happen as Avner, Boxee&#39;s CEO <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/02/18/the-hulu-situation/">outlined on the Boxee blog</a>.</p><p>Boxee is a browser optimized for the 10 ft experience. Much like mobile browsers on phones, Boxee renders the content it finds on the web in a way that optimizes it for the device it runs on (in Boxee&#39;s case that is the TV). Boxee is also an RSS reader optimized for the 10 ft experience. Content owners may initially see broswers and RSS readers optimized for TV viewing as disruptive and threatening, but just like mobile browsers are the friend of content owners, so are TV browsers. And Boxee is by far the best TV browser out there for a host of reasons that I outlined in <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/11/boxee.html">this post when we made our investment in Boxee</a>.</p><p>Here&#39;s how I came to understand the power of Boxee.</p><p>I used to watch Hulu on my living room TV in the Safari browser:<br /><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e201116860090b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Hulu on web" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e201116860090b970c " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e201116860090b970c-500wi" /></a>
 </p><p>Now I watch Hulu on my living room TV in Boxee:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011168600985970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Hulu on boxee" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2011168600985970c " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011168600985970c-500wi" /></a>
 </span> </p><p>It&#39;s the same content on the same device coming through the same pipe and the only difference is safari is a browser optimized for a computer with a keyboard and a mouse and Boxee is a browser optimized for a TV and a remote.</p><p>I spent some time this evening reading the comments on the Hulu blog post. I commend Hulu for being open and transparent about this decision and allowing the community to discuss and debate this decision out in the open. That&#39;s the way to do this kind of thing. Naturally, users are upset. There are <a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2009/2/18/doing-hard-things">over seventy comments already on the Hulu blog</a> and <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/02/18/the-hulu-situation/">over two hundred comments on the Boxee blog</a>. As <a href="http://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1225018531">I tweeted earlier tonite</a>, I hope that Hulu and its content partners take the time to read these comments and think about them.</p><p>There&#39;s a consistency to the comments and it is confusion first and foremost. Hulu users don&#39;t understand the distinction between watching Hulu through Firefox or Safari and wathicng Hulu through Boxee. And many of them are coming back to watching TV because they can watch over the internet, when they want, and how they want. They feel liberated by Hulu and Boxee and see them as a match made in heaven. Which they are. And I sure hope that Hulu and its content partners come to that realization quickly.</p><fieldset class="zemanta-related"><legend class="zemanta-related-title">Related articles by Zemanta</legend><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090218/p91">Doing hard things (Hulu Blog)</a> (techmeme.com)</li>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/extracting-insight-from-stock-research-analysts.html">Extracting Insight From Stock Research Analysts</a></h2>


<p>Wall Street research has been in a long and steady decline for years. Between the obvious loss of objectivity brought on by huge investment banking fees being paid to &quot;buy coverage&quot; and regulations like FD which made it almost impossible to get any information out of companies, Wall Street research has lost a lot of its mojo in the past decade.</p><p>But that does not mean that there aren&#39;t good analysts doing good work. Many of them are not at the large banks and brokerage firms anymore and some of them are even blogging for a living.</p><p>There&#39;s a new service launching today called <a href="http://pulse.alacra.com">Pulse</a> that does a nice job aggregating a lot of these voices, not in the form of research reports, but in the form of relevant comments made about public companies.</p><p>I should disclose that I am a shareholder and director of <a href="http://alacra.com/">Alacra</a>, the company that is behind Pulse. I&#39;ve been an investor in Alacra for over ten years and I know the team and the quality of the work they do and Pulse is yet another example of a great product coming out of Alacra.</p><p>The thing about Pulse is its &quot;real time&quot; and you get a sense of what analysts are saying right now. Another thing I like is that their definition of analyst is very broad. Most people would not think of Kara Swisher as an analyst, but you can see her comments about companies in Pulse:<br /><a href="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011278f91cca28a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Alacra Street Pulse - Analyst - Alternative - Swisher[1]" class="at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2011278f91cca28a4 " src="http://www.avc.com/.a/6a00d83451b2c969e2011278f91cca28a4-500wi" /></a>
 </p><p>You can also see all my comments about public companies <a href="http://pulse.alacra.com/analyst-comments/Wilson_Fred-A16239">here</a>.</p><p>But Pulse is really more about full-time professional stock analysts like Doug Freedman, a semiconductor analyst at American Technology Research. You can see his comments <a href="http://pulse.alacra.com/analyst-comments/Freedman_Doug-A3800">here</a>.</p><p>If you are an investor or trader who values getting the &quot;pulse of the street&quot; then I think Pulse will be a valuable new service for you. <a href="http://pulse.alacra.com/analyst-comments">Check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/from-blog-to-forum.html">From Blog To Forum</a></h2>


<p>Over the past week, from Feb 9th to Feb 16th, this blog has been more of a forum than a traditional blog. Here&#39;s some stats:</p><p>Total Posts: 9<br />Total Comments Received: 672<br />Avg Comments/Post: 75<br />Unique Commenters: 314</p><p>What&#39;s most impressive to me is that these are not silly comments like LOL or you suck. These are well written, articulate, and informative comments. Many could be blog posts in their own right.</p><p>Take a look at the comments to <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/does-apple-have-a-blind-spot-about-flash.html">my post yesterday on Apple and Flash</a>. I got completely and totally trashed in that discussion and rightly so as I suggested that Flash is open, which it is not, and missed out on the trend toward HTML5 based solutions. But if you want an education on the future of streaming video and audio on the web, you&#39;ll get it in that comment thread. You&#39;ll also witness commenters calling me stupid and an idiot, which isn&#39;t fun to hear. But if you want a community, you have to have tough skin sometimes.</p><p>The discussion that ensued regarding <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/how-patent-trolls-are-a-tax-on-innovation.html">my post on patent trolls</a> is equally fascinating. Most of the comments were sympathetic with my views, but as usual, they added a lot to the discussion and I learned a lot from them. If you take the time to read them, you&#39;ll hear from the small inventors who would lose out if my suggestions were implemented and the victims of patent trolls who shed even more light on the problems that initiated my post.</p><p>But the post that generated the most comments this past week is <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/the-blogroll-i-want-for-avc.html">the one where I outlined the kind of blogroll I&#39;d like for this blog</a>. That got 151 comments and turned into a live discussion of how one could build it and what it should do and how it should work. Even more impressive is I got somwhere around five live working versions of the blogroll that I am now testing.</p><p>I believe this community is one of the liveliest blog communities I know of. And it&#39;s come about for several reasons. First, being a VC investor is a huge advantage. Entrepreneurs flock here to get a sense of what I am thinking about. If I was just another tech pundit, this blog would not be the same. I realize that. But when you get thousands of web entrepreneurs reading this blog every day, you get magic. </p><p>Another reason is the <a href="http://disqus.com">disqus comment system</a>. You all know that our firm is an investor in Disqus and I am biased. But I&#39;ve used all of the comment systems out there. I leave about five or ten comments a day on blogs other than this one. There is no better system out there. I&#39;ll defend that statement until I am blue in the face. And you are seeing the power of the disqus system on this blog. It turns blogs into forums if you use it right.</p><p>The final reason is that I engage in the comments. Of those 672 comments, I bet 100 were mine. I don&#39;t reply to every comment, but I reply to many. And those replies start threads which are some of the best discussions of all in the comments.</p><p>All of this is fantastic for many reasons but there is one that stands out as the most valuable to me. It makes me a better investor. Kontra said this in <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/does-apple-have-a-blind-spot-about-flash.html#comment-6325572">his comment on the Apple/Flash thing</a>:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Hopefully, you have people advising you on platform choices on a strategic level, going beyond press releases.</em><br /></div><p>I do have people advising me. It&#39;s you. And thank you for doing such a damn good job of it.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/why-patent-trolls-are-a-tax-on-innovation-continued.html">Why Patent Trolls Are A Tax On Innovation (continued)</a></h2>


<p>Matt Blumberg, CEO of our portfolio company Return Path, has <a href="http://onlyonce.blogs.com/onlyonce/2009/02/the-evils-of-patent-litigation.html">a post on his blog today about the patent troll issue</a>. His company,<a href="http://www.returnpath.net/"> Return Path</a>, is the company that spent $500,000 last year defending itself against a baseless patent infringement claim.</p><p>Matt says:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>I should know.<span>&#0160;
</span>We are the company that he refers to who spent about half a million
dollars successfully defending ourselves (for now - who knows what appeals
might bring) against a baseless suit by a patent troll.<span>&#0160; </span>For the record, we did try to settle and were
presented with a multi-million dollar option only.<span>&#0160; </span>I have been advised by our lawyer not to
write about this case because there are elements of it that are still pending,
but I don&#39;t care.<span>&#0160; </span>I&#39;m irritated enough
about it that I want to get this out there while it&#39;s still fresh in my mind.<span>&#0160; </span>And I&#39;m not going to use names here or say
anything I wouldn&#39;t say publicly in any other forum.</em><br /></div><p>Matt goes on to make one additional recommendation in the ongoing debate about patent reform.

<h2><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/does-apple-have-a-blind-spot-about-flash.html">Does Apple Have A Blind Spot About Flash?</a></h2>


<p>I think the news that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/02/15/mobile-flash-apps-get-better-distribution-more-money/">Flash is coming to smartphones over the next year</a> is a big deal. Most of the rich media experiences I have on the web are in flash. YouTube&#39;s success had a lot to do with its choice of Flash for its video player. Now almost every video site on the web uses a Flash video player. The same is true of audio. It used to be that when you wanted to listen to streaming audio, you had to use windows media player, the real player, or a link to iTunes, but all that&#39;s gone, thanks again to Flash. Whether its <a class="zem_slink" href="http://last.fm" rel="homepage" title="Last.fm">last.fm</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://Pandora.com" rel="homepage" title="Pandora">Pandora</a>, most radio station web streams, or <a href="http://hypem.com/">hypemachine</a>, you are listening via Flash.</p><p>I have been able to port most of my web activity pretty seamlessly to a smartphone, either iPhone or Blackberry. But the one thing I&#39;ve not been able to replicate is the seamless experiences of watching video or listening to streaming audio on my phone (downloading an app to listen to music is not seamless). I realize that the mobile networks may not yet be ready for hundreds of millions of people watching or listening to streaming media on their smartphones, but they will be someday and getting Flash onto smartphones is going to accelerate the demand for this.</p><p>It&#39;s also true that a lot of the interesting new desktop apps like <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.twhirl.org" rel="homepage" title="Twhirl">Twhirl</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">Tweetdeck</a> are written for AIR, Flash&#39;s runtime cousin for the desktop. I&#39;d love to have apps like this on my smartphone too.</p><p>So it&#39;s very exciting to me that Flash is making a big move over the next year onto smartphones. I&#39;m also very excited to see <a class="zem_slink" href="http://nokia.com" rel="homepage" title="Nokia">Nokia</a> and Adobe creating <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobeNokia.html">the Open Screen Project and Open Screen Fund</a> to promote an open and consistent experience for web browsing and mobile apps across mobile devices. The mobile web needs to be just like the web for innovation to flourish and capital to flow.</p><p>Which takes me back to the title of this post. I believe <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=aapl" rel="homepage" title="Apple">Apple</a> is making a mistake by snubbing Adobe&#39;s desire to get Flash on the iPhone. And I believe Apple doesn&#39;t share in Adobe and Nokia&#39;s vision of an open and consistent experience for web browsing and mobile apps. It seems to me that Apple is interested in replicating its iTunes/iPod strategy it used to dominate digital music to dominate the mobile web.</p><p>I don&#39;t think that will work. In fact, I don&#39;t think the iTunes/iPod strategy has much life left in it. Things like Pandora, MySpace Music, music blogging, and other forms of streaming music will eventually chip away at that franchise. But leaving the digital music situation alone for the moment, the mobile web is not going to be dominated by a single device and a single app ecosystem. I don&#39;t even think an app ecosystem is the long term solution for the mobile web. It&#39;s a bridge enviroment that allows for rich experiences on devices that don&#39;t have reliable high bandwidth connections yet.</p><p>But the mobile web will eventually just be the web. And a big part of getting it there is to get the tools that allow us to seamlessly consume rich media on the web onto mobile devices. To me that means Flash. I&#39;m rooting for Adobe and its allies like Nokia and Palm (and hopefully Blackberry) to win this game. If they do, we&#39;ll all be much better off because of it.</p><fieldset class="zemanta-related"><legend class="zemanta-related-title">Related articles by Zemanta</legend><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/02/15/did-adobe-snub-apple-with-flashplayer-10-and-development-fund-announcements/">Did Adobe snub Apple with FlashPlayer 10, Palm Pre, and Development Fund announcements?</a> (scobleizer.com)</li>
